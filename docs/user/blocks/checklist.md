# Checklist Block

The checklist block allows you to create a list of items that participants can check off as they complete them. This block is interactive and optionally awards points when all items are checked off. You can use it to guide participants through a series of tasks or to ensure they have completed all necessary steps.

## Notes

Participants cannot proceed to the next location until all items are checked off. If you want to allow participants to proceed without completing the checklist, consider using a [Text Block](/docs/user/blocks/text) to provide instructions instead.

Players are awarded **full points** for the checklist block when all items are checked off, and the block is marked as complete.

The clues and help text can be formatted using [Markdown](/docs/user/markdown-guide). In the example below, links are included to an external quiz.

## Example

Note, points are not enabled in this example.
