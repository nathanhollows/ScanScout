# YouTube Block

The YouTube block allows you to embed a YouTube video directly into a location page. This block is not interactive and does not award points. It accepts any valid YouTube URL, including YouTube Shorts.

## Notes

Links for YouTube Shorts are automatically converted to the full video URL. This is because the YouTube API does not support Shorts, so the full video is required to display the video preview.

If you want to ensure participants watch the video, you can use a [Checklist Block](/docs/user/blocks/checklist), [Password Block](/docs/user/blocks/password), or [Pincode Block](/docs/user/blocks/pincode) to require them to answer a question or enter a code after watching the video.

## Example
